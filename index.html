    Hello World!

  </p>
  <p>
        
    My name is Nathaniel Edillon, and I am a student at the <i>University of Alberta</i> in my third year of studying Computer 
    Engineering. I'm curious about computer technology, and have always been fascinated about the current innovations that 
    constantly evolve our world. Although I don't consider myself much of a web developer, I wanted to showcase to you what I 
    have been working on here on my own website! Enjoy!

  </p>

  <h3>Fruit Ninja in Pygame!</h3>

  <p>

    This is <i>the</i> first project I've ever publicly shared! A very basic and incomplete version of Fruit Ninja, made in Pygame!

  </p>

  <p>

    Like the real game, the objective is to slice fruit for as long as you can, without hitting any bombs. In this version, the
    various fruits and bombs/rockets you can come across are Minecraft sprites I <i>politely borrowed</i> (the files were already
    in my system at the time). The game would run indefinitely and get progressively more hectic until you failed by hitting a rocket
    or missing a fruit.

  </p>

  <p>

    As I mentioned this game is very incomplete. No UI exists and all important details are simply printed out in the command line.
    You start the game by pressing the space bar, and then you slice away with your mouse. If you hit a rocket, any other sprites on
    screen abruptly disappear, and if you miss just one fruit you'll know the game ended when the game stops throwing things out
    (plus a message that appears again in the command line). It also looks pretty dull with a basic trail, no flashy effects, not
    even audio. 

  </p>

  <p>

    But this is what I could make at the time, with the time constraints and limited knowledge known about the engine, and is what I
    presented at the Schulich Ignite Fall 2021 Gala. Schulich Ignite is a student-led coding bootcamp at the University of Calgary,
    and for eight weeks these college students taught me basic OOP concepts to help me create this game in Pygame.

  </p>

  <p>

    This was a fun project, and was monumental in that this was one of my first hands-on, extracurricular experiences that
    strengthened my passion for coding and admiration for technology, especially in the computer graphics field.
