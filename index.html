    Hello World!

  </p>
  <p>
        
    My name is Nathaniel Edillon, and I am a student at the <i>University of Alberta</i> in my third year of studying Computer 
    Engineering. I'm curious about computer technology, and have always been fascinated about the current innovations that 
    constantly evolve our world. Although I don't consider myself much of a web developer, I wanted to showcase to you what I 
    have been working on here on my own website! Enjoy!

  </p>

  <p>Um, that's awkward...</p>

    If you're reading this, it means you've accessed my website earlier than I expected.
    I haven't had the chance to upload any of my projects yet, but trust me, there should be some here soon!

  </p>

  <p>

    Mind you that this site is <i>very</i> early in development as I re-learn HTML and CSS, 
    and I will be updating it and moving things around as I go along. This website could look very
    different later on, so stay tuned!
